  "transportAdvice": "Amritsar's main attractions, including the Golden Temple, are clustered enough that walking between them is practical for most visitors; cycle rickshaws and auto-rickshaws are widely available and affordable for longer distances. Taxis can be hired locally for day trips, and the city is served by a modest local bus network, though most tourists rely on auto-rickshaws or pre-arranged vehicles.",
