  "transportAdvice": "Manama has a public bus network that covers major areas, though services can be infrequent and routes may not reach all tourist sites conveniently; taxis are widely available and a practical option for getting around. The city is generally not walkable due to heat, distances, and limited pedestrian infrastructure, so having a reliable transport option is recommended.",
