  "transportAdvice": "Maun is a sprawling town where walking between attractions is generally impractical due to distances and heat; taxis and hired vehicles are the primary means of getting around for tourists. Public minibus transport exists but is limited in coverage and not well-suited to tourist areas, so most visitors rely on lodge transfers, safari operators, or privately arranged taxis.",
