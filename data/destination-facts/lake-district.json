  "transportAdvice": "The Lake District is served by regional bus services connecting major towns and villages, though coverage can be infrequent in more remote areas, making a hire car the most practical option for exploring widely. Taxis are available in larger towns, and some areas around Windermere and Ambleside are walkable, but the rugged terrain means many attractions require dedicated transport.",
