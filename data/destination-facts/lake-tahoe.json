  "transportAdvice": "Lake Tahoe has limited public bus service connecting some resort towns and communities around the lake, but a car is strongly recommended as walking between attractions is generally impractical given the spread-out nature of the region. Taxis and ride-hail services are available but can be scarce outside peak seasons, so arranging transport in advance is advisable.",
