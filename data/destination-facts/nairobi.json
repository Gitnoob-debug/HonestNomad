  "transportAdvice": "Nairobi has a public bus network and shared minibus taxis that cover much of the city, though routes can be confusing for first-time visitors; metered taxis and ride-hailing services are widely available and recommended for tourists. Walking is practical in specific commercial and upmarket districts but less advisable in many areas due to traffic and safety concerns, so having a reliable taxi option is essential.",
