  "transportAdvice": "Napa Valley has limited public transit, with a regional bus network that connects some towns but does not comprehensively cover wine country attractions, making a rental car the most practical option for most visitors. Taxis and ride-hail services are available but can be sparse outside of town centers, and walking between wineries is generally not feasible given the rural, spread-out nature of the region.",
