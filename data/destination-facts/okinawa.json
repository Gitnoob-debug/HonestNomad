  "transportAdvice": "Okinawa's main island is best explored by rental car or scooter, as public buses cover major routes but can be infrequent and slow for reaching beach and rural attractions; a monorail serves central Naha city including the main shopping and cultural areas. Taxis are widely available and metered, making them a reliable option for shorter trips, though renting a vehicle is strongly recommended for independent exploration of the island.",
