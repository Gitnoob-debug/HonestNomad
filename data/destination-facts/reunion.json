  "transportAdvice": "Saint-Denis has a public bus network that connects the city center and some tourist areas, though coverage can be limited and infrequent outside urban zones; taxis are widely available and recommended for reaching more remote or mountainous areas. The city center is walkable for short distances, but the island's hilly terrain and spread-out attractions make personal or hired transport the most practical option for exploring beyond downtown.",
