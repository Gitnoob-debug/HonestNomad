  "transportAdvice": "Rio has a metro system that connects key tourist areas including Ipanema, Copacabana, and the city center, and is generally the safest and most reliable way to get around; buses cover a wider network but can be crowded and harder to navigate. Taxis and ride-hailing services are widely available and recommended for travel at night or to areas not well served by the metro, while walking is practical within beachside neighborhoods but less advisable in unfamiliar or poorly lit areas.",
