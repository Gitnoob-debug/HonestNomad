  "transportAdvice": "Valparaíso is a hilly port city where walking is practical in the flat port and downtown areas, though the steep cerros (hills) are best navigated via the historic funicular elevators or local minibuses; taxis and shared colectivo taxis are widely available for longer distances. Public buses connect the city to nearby Viña del Mar and other coastal towns, making it easy to explore the region without a car.",
